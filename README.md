# PyCGen - Python PC Generator

This is a simple character sheet generator for DND 5e, in very early form.

It asks you a bunch of questions and populates a tex file which will compile to a character sheet.
You are going to have to go through the sheet and edit things (equipment, fluff, etc), but most
calculations are done by the script.

## Features

 - [x] Create basic character sheet
 - [x] Create armour items
 - [ ] Create other items
 - [ ] Use known items smartly in generation script


## Requirements

The python script needs `requirements.txt`, and the latex file requires [DND 5e LaTeX Character Sheet Template](https://github.com/matsavage/DND-5e-LaTeX-Character-Sheet-Template) .
